The graph below shows the effect of adjusting the tilt. The turquoise line 
shows the amount of solar energy you would get each day if the panel is fixed 
at the full year angle. The red line shows how much you would get by adjusting 
the tilt four times a year as described below. For comparison, the green line 
shows the energy you would get from two-axis tracking, which always points the 
panel directly at the sun. (The violet line is the solar energy per day if the 
panel is fixed at the winter angle, discussed below.) These figures are calculated 
for 40Â° latitude.
