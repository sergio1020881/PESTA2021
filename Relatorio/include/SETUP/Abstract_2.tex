	\label{Summary}
	\par The proposed project is to build a weighing scale using a microcontroller, an embedded system.
	\\
	\\
	A load cell is what is going to be used to convert the measured weight into a potential difference with a Wheatstone configuration, generating a proportional signal.
	\\
	\\
	After obtaining this signal it is going to be connected to a load cell amplifier with a \ac{adc} dedicated for this type of application, it has a 24 bit resolution, programable amplification and sampling rate physically programmable, this is the \textbf{HX711} chip, having a proprietary communication protocol.
	This information then will be passed to the microcontroller.
	\\
	\\
	The \ac{mcu} programming code, libraries and or drivers are to be implemented using the \textbf{C} language. The objective of this project is to get a functional weighing scale easy to use and to calibrate economically viable, in order to have a practical weight scale.
	\\
	\\
	This work is targeted to a public with some basic electrical knowledge with electronic and programming background.
