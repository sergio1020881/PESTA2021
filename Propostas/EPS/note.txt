Erasmus seems to only accept foreign students, 
it is a priviledged channel since the fees are four 
times more expensive than a regular student, more 
like a tour style education with guaranteed pass rate.
Making universities make their internal education 
system in second plane, flunking the students with much 
more harsh evaluation so they may retain the cash flow, 
while Erasmus pass on the fly entering the market earlier 
getting the best positions with good marks, while sacrificing
the rest and when finished their validity have passed dew to age
and a worse final result. Europe seems to become a monarchy of 
the rich were their blood line is guaranteed to replace future 
places of power, the rest slaves, why they do not even need them for 
they have access to money supply, they print the money, lol.

It is wise for the new generation to tell them to shove it, 
and wait until they pay off the created debt, 
they have no morals to demand anything.

Are they not so intelectual and wise, then let them pay the debt,
look how hard working they are. LOL.

Ironic.
