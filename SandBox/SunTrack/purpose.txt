The objective is to make a sun track device on one fixed axis [W E] using a servo motor 
(38 degrees for N S axis has pre determined by institute for solar panels in Portugal), it will have a manual 
override in witch you type in the angle, or automatic where it will have pre-defined 
position programmed syncronized by a clock (clock is pre programmed also by menu), it will have a margin of error that is 
rectified using two LDR sensors circuit consisting of a intrumentation amplifier in wheatstone format input.
The sun rise time and sun down time are the start and end cycle that is then devided by 5 or any other 
number of precise position, and the diference between these angles is then rectified by the sensor in that margin of error, 
or in certain small partions of time the sensor will do the positioning around a determined precise value.
Could use the SPA library and use only the clock for positioning, but the mcu does not have suficient float precision, 
or use a table, ignoring completely the sensor part, but for academic purpose is so.
